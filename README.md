# Coca-Cola-Campaign-Analysis

## Task Description

I gathered the posts metrics manually (no authorized access to the account) and compiled them into a [csv file](https://github.com/jenn-db/Coca-Cola-Campaign-Analysis/blob/main/Coke_IG_posts.csv). I then imported the data to Tableau and created four charts to help make informed decisions.

Finally, I created a presentation to:
* Showcase the process.
* Explain each chart in the Tableau and suggest actionanble items.
* Recommend personas.
* Make recommendations based on findings for next campaigns.
